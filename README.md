## Built With ðŸ› 
- ```Kotlin``` - First class and official programming language for Android development.
- ```RecyclerView``` - RecyclerView is a ViewGroup added to the android studio as a successor of the GridView and ListView. It is an improvement on both of them and can be found in the latest v-7 support packages.
- ```Data Class``` -  We frequently create classes whose main purpose is to hold data. In such a class some standard functionality and utility functions are often mechanically derivable from the data. In Kotlin, this is called a data class and is marked as data : data class User(val name: String, val age: Int)
- ```Layout``` - A layout defines the structure for a user interface in your app, such as in an activity. All elements in the layout are built using a hierarchy of View and ViewGroup objects. A View usually draws something the user can see and interact with.
- ```Activity``` - An activity is a single, focused thing that the user can do. Almost all activities interact with the user, so the Activity class takes care of creating a window for you in which you can place your UI with setContentView(View).
- ```Material Components for Android``` - Modular and customizable Material Design UI components for Android
